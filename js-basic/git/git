//what is git ?? 
//git is a version controle system (VCS)
//what does a VCS do ? 

//-it allows us to SAVE OUR WORK 

// we can make different version of our code in to a three like system 

// for example: 

//-first commit (time stamp)
//-second feature added (time stamp)
//-third  feature added (time stamp)

// and the power of a VCS is that at any point we could revert back to any previus save. 
// and this is so great because we can remove code that are bugged or dosent contribute to the code.

// plus we can automatically keep a detailed history of our work. 

// git is very good cuz it make the ppl accountable of their saves. 
//because u can see what ppl are putting in. 

// we can also merge different codes together. 

// this also lets us branch out and experiment with code. 

//new branch!!

//-third feature
//-new commit
//-new commit

// this means to work in pararel. 


// now how to make a git repository 

// ls = will list all of the files in that living in that diretory 

// to make a new directory 
//'git_start'

// cd = change directory 
// cd git_start/ 

//git command to initialise our repository to this new directory we just created 
// het init = git initialize 
// by doing this it will ask you some basic varibales to get started on the new project
//just press enter and ur good to go 

// now if u were to use "ls" it would look empty 
//but if u use "ls-la" it will also be able to see the hiden files. 
// "ls-la" = list all files AND the hiden ones
