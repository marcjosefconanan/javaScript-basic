console.log(10 < 11) // this is already true cuz 11 in indeed greater than 10. (10<11 this means 11 is greater than 10 which is true)
console.log(45 == 45) // i changed the number 34 to 45 because this "==" means that their equal in numerical value and 34 and 45 arent equal in value so to make the boolean value true i had to change one the numbers to match the other.
console.log(true === true) // same thing with this one this is "===" absolute equal it only sayas true when their the same value and the same type of data aka true === 1 = false so i change it to true === true = true.
console.log(false === false) // idem as the aswere above. 
console.log(1 == 1) // same thing with 45 == 34. 
console.log(4 <= 6) //this "4<=6" means that 4 is less or equal to 6 so the answere is true. but with the given it says "4<=2" meaning 4 is less or equal to 2 which is false.  
console.log(10 >= 8) // the othe way around
