//naming is realy important in javascript not only because a wrong naming method will give u errors
//but also a good and clear naming of variables can make for a cleaner and more organized code.

//so like in the previous lesson we saw that in javascript the camelCase is preffered 
//because with the use of other naming tyles like the use of kebab-cases that is usually used in css code 
//does not work on javascript because of the element "-".

// javascript will allways trow an error with numbers at the start of ur variable names ex: 1variable 
// *but u can put numbers at the end of ur variable names and its acceptable ex: variable1

//u most definitely cant use these symbols that means something in javascript in ur variable names ex:
// >< +- !? () [] {}.

// u can make a varibale as specific or non specific as u want for ex: 
let t = 4;

let time = 4;

let timeOfDay = "4:00";

let thisIsTheTimeOfDayToday = "4:00";

// lets be carefull because copying a long ass name every time is really annoying. so a mix of clear and specific and abreviation would be nice.
